# T9A statistic calculator

*My first app made in Android Studio to help me with my favorite hobby.*

My hobby is tabletop wargame "The 9th Age". It's strategy but not like chess because success of action is often defined by die rolling.

For example, 4+ means that 4,5,6 are successes and 1,2,3 are failre.

Roll needed depends on characteristics of both attacker and receiver of damage.
This app is designed to calculate average expectations for attack rolls. 

So if we have 10 attacks hitting on 4+ we'll get 5 hits on average.
However, it's a little bit more complicated due to fact that there is also to-wound roll followed after to-hit.
As well as 2 layers of defence: armor and special save (aegis or fortitude).

Calculation is getting even more complex because some situations allow to reroll failed rolls or make to reroll successes.
And there are special rules like "6's to-hit wound automatically" or "6's to-wound ignore armor and fortitude".

So I decided to make a tool that will always be in my pocket that would tell me which buff-spell is better for the situation or 
do I have good chances of winning upcoming combat or retreat would be a better option. Looking forward to ckeck it in action at the tournament next weekend.
